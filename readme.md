# STIB Shortest Route Finder

## Overview

This project is a **Shortest Route Finder** for the STIB transport network in Brussels. It allows users to find the most efficient route between two stations by calculating the shortest path.

## Features

- **Shortest Route Calculation**: Uses graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra) to find the optimal route between two stations.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A visual interface for selecting start and end stations, displaying the route on a map.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** for the backend route-finding logic.
- **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) for shortest path calculations.
- **GUI Framework**: JavaFX for Java
  
## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8** or later
- An **IDE** like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   
2. **For Java**: Open the project in your IDE and build it using Maven.
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```



4. **Run the application**:
    Execute the main class 

## Usage

1. Select a **starting station** and an **ending station** from the interface.
2. The system will display the **shortest route** between these two stations.
